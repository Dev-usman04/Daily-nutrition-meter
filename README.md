Here's a summary of my Nutrition Meter project:

This is a React-based nutrition tracking application that offers:

Core Functionality:
Track food items with their nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
Add, edit, and delete food items
Adjust quantities of each item
Calculate total nutritional values
Key Features:
Pre-loaded default food items
Real-time calorie tracking with warnings when exceeding 1000 calories
Form validation for input fields
Responsive grid layout
Technical Implementation:
Built with React and Vite
Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
Implements Framer Motion for animations
Uses FontAwesome icons for UI elements
Includes state management with React hooks
The app provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring daily nutrition intake with smooth animations and a modern design using a green and white color scheme.

The project can be run using npm run dev and built using npm run build as defined in package.json.
